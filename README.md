# Contextualised Word Representations for Lexical Semantic Change

This is a repository for the paper:

Mario Giulianelli, Marco Del Tredici, and Raquel Fern√°ndez. 2020. [Analysing Lexical Semantic Change with Contextualised Word Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14118). In _Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2020). Association for Computational Linguistics_.

We also make public the [DUPS (Diachronic Usage Pair Similarity)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3773250) dataset, which contains similarity judgements of English word usage pairs from different time periods, as described in the paper.
